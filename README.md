Project Overview
This repository contains a Flask-based REST API that serves as a backend for a mental health chatbot. The chatbot uses a TensorFlow neural network model trained on various mental health-related intents to provide appropriate responses to user messages.
Technical Architecture
Core Components

TensorFlow Neural Network Model

Architecture: Feedforward neural network with 2 hidden layers
Input Layer: Matches the TF-IDF vector size (500 features)
Hidden Layers: 64 units (with 30% dropout) → 32 units (with 20% dropout)
Output Layer: Softmax activation matching the number of intent categories (82)
Optimizer: Adam optimizer with learning rate of 0.0005
Loss Function: Categorical cross-entropy
Training: Early stopping with patience of 10 epochs, reducing learning rate on plateau


Text Processing Pipeline

Vectorization: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
Features: 500 max features, unigrams and bigrams (1-2 word combinations)
Text Normalization: Sublinear TF scaling


Backend API

Framework: Flask with RESTful endpoint design
CORS: Enabled for cross-origin requests
Endpoint: /predict for intent classification and response generation



Data Files

chatbot_model.h5: TensorFlow model in HDF5 format
vectorizer.pkl: Serialized TF-IDF vectorizer
label_encoder.pkl: Serialized label encoder for intent mapping
intents.json: JSON file containing intent patterns and responses
chatbot_model.pkl: Backup pickled version of the model (for compatibility)

Intent Structure
The model is trained on a diverse set of intents (82 categories) with the following distribution:

Conversation starters (greeting, goodbye, thanks)
Emotional states (sad, stressed, happy, anxious, etc.)
Mental health facts
Help requests and support responses
Time-specific greetings (morning, afternoon, evening)

Each intent follows this JSON structure:
json{
  "tag": "intent_name",
  "patterns": ["Example user input 1", "Example user input 2"],
  "responses": ["Possible bot response 1", "Possible bot response 2"]
}
Model Performance

Training Data: 248+ patterns across 82 intent categories (augmented for categories with limited examples)
Vocabulary Size: 267 features after TF-IDF processing
Accuracy: Approximately 95-98% on the validation set
Response Generation: Random selection from predefined responses for the predicted intent

API Endpoints
GET /

Description: Home endpoint to verify API is running
Response: {"message": "Welcome to the TensorFlow Chatbot API!"}

POST /predict

Description: Processes user message and returns appropriate response
Request Body:
json{
  "message": "User message here"
}

Response:
json{
  "intent": "detected_intent",
  "response": "Bot response based on intent",
  "confidence": 0.95
}


Model Training Process
The model was trained using the following approach:

Data Preparation:

Collection of user message patterns for each intent
Organization into tag-based categories
Data augmentation for categories with limited examples


Text Vectorization:

Conversion of text patterns to numerical features using TF-IDF
Feature engineering with unigram and bigram extraction


Model Training:

Batch size of 8 for better generalization with limited data
Learning rate of 0.0005 with reduction on plateau
Early stopping to prevent overfitting
90-10 train-test split


Optimization:

Dropout layers to prevent overfitting (30% and 20%)
Regularization through early stopping
Adaptive learning rate adjustment



Installation and Deployment
Prerequisites

Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.x
Flask
scikit-learn
NLTK

Setup

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mental-health-chatbot.git
cd mental-health-chatbot

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Ensure all model files are in the ./data/ directory:

chatbot_model.h5
vectorizer.pkl
label_encoder.pkl
intents.json


Start the Flask server:
python app.py


The server will be available at http://localhost:5000.
Production Deployment Recommendations
For production deployment:

Use a production WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI
Set debug=False in the Flask application
Implement proper error handling and logging
Add authentication for API endpoints
Consider containerizing the application with Docker
Set up HTTPS for secure communication

Model Limitations and Considerations

Limited Training Data: The model performs best with patterns similar to its training data. Unusual phrasings may result in lower confidence predictions.
Fixed Response Set: The chatbot selects from predefined responses rather than generating new ones.
No Conversation Memory: The current implementation doesn't maintain conversation context between requests.
Mental Health Context: This chatbot is designed to provide supportive responses but is not a replacement for professional mental health services.
Security Considerations: The pickle files should be handled securely as they can potentially execute arbitrary code if tampered with.

Future Improvements

Enhanced Model Architecture: Implement transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa) for better understanding of user intents
Conversation Memory: Add session management to maintain context across multiple messages
Dynamic Response Generation: Implement more sophisticated response generation rather than template-based responses
Personalization
