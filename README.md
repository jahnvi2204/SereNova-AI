Flask-based RESTful API that serves as a chatbot backend. It loads a pre-trained machine learning model (likely a text classifier) that takes user messages, predicts their intent using natural language processing, and returns appropriate responses based on that intent. The system uses a combination of TensorFlow (potentially), scikit-learn, and Flask to provide a simple question-answering service.
