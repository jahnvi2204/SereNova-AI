Flask-based RESTful API that serves as a chatbot backend. It loads a pre-trained machine learning model (likely a text classifier) that takes user messages, predicts their intent using natural language processing, and returns appropriate responses based on that intent. The system uses a combination of TensorFlow (potentially), scikit-learn, and Flask to provide a simple question-answering service.

Flask serves as the web framework handling HTTP requests
Pre-trained ML model (loaded from pickle files) processes the text
Text vectorizer converts raw text into features the model can understand
Label encoder translates between numeric model outputs and human-readable intent labels
Intents JSON file stores predefined responses for each intent
REST API endpoints allow clients to interact with the chatbot
